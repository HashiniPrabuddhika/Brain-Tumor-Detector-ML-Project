# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detector

This project uses deep learning to detect **brain tumors** from MRI scan images.  
It leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification and provides an end-to-end pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 🚀 Features
- 🩺 Preprocesses MRI scan images for training and testing  
- 🤖 Uses CNN for accurate brain tumor classification  
- 📊 Supports visualization of training/validation accuracy and loss  
- 🔮 Can predict tumor presence on new MRI images  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy, Pandas**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **OpenCV / PIL** (for image processing)
